# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to summarize ride-sharing data by city type and to look at total fares for each city type
## Results

Judging from the above image of our summary we can see that Urban cities have the most total rides, drivers, and fares. However, urban cities have the lowest fare per ride and fare per driver. Rural cities have the highest fare per ride and driver

From this above image we can see that urban cities overall most steadily earn the most money of all city types, but urban cities took a big dip in fare in April
## Summary
Recommendations I have for addressing disparities in the city types are:
1. Hiring fewer drivers in urban cities because they have almost 800 drivers more than rides, so the supply of the workforce is higher than the demand of ride-shares in urban cities
2. Try to move drivers to make more rides in rural areas because if they make more rides in rural cities they generate more money per ride and driver
